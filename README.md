=========

This is a simulational framework. The simulation concerns tunnel evacuation in fire conditions. We're using [Fire Dynamics Simulator](https://code.google.com/p/fds-smv/) to generate physics data. Two crowd models are implemented:

* Social Distances Cellular Automata,
* Continuous Space Discreet Time (*experimental*).

Tunnel data files, articles, books, videos are available in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_i70p9NE-kpUFFjOGRtUXE4ams).

See [this runtime video](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_i70p9NE-kpYWxsZ0JFb3c5RzA) for more details.
